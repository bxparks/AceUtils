/**
 * Base class for all template instances of the PrintString<SIZE> class. A
 * common base class reduces the code size because only one copy of the core
 * code is included across all possible template instances. Otherwise,
 * PrintString<10> is a different class than PrintString<20> and would pull in
 * duplicate copies of the code.
 *
 * Usually the `Print` base class can be used to accept instances of the
 * `PrintString<SIZE>` objects. However, if you need access to the `lenth()`
 * method, then you need to use the `PrintStringBase` class instead, since the
 * `Print` class does not have a `length()` method.
 *
 * Here are the actual numbers. I modified tests/CommonTest.ino program to use
 * 2 template instances, PrintString<10> and PrintString<20> instead of just
 * PrintString<10>. Without this base class optimization, the sketch uses:
 *
 *    * 10030 bytes (32%) of program storage space,
 *    * 710 bytes (34%) of dynamic memory on an Arduino Nano.
 *
 * After inserting this PrintStringBase class in the class hierarchy, the same
 * sketch uses:
 *
 *    * 9936 bytes (32%) of program storage space,
 *    * 698 bytes (34%) of dynamic memory,
 *
 * So we save 94 bytes of flash memory, and 12 bytes of static RAM. And even
 * better, the program and RAM size was the same as using 2 PrintString<10>
 * instances. In other words, the amount of flash and static RAM remains
 * constant no matter how many template instances we create.

/**
 * An implementation of `Print` that writes to an in-memory buffer supporting
 * strings less than 65535 in length. It is intended to be an alternative to
 * the `String` class to help avoid heap fragmentation due to repeated creation
 * and deletion of small String objects. The 'PrintString' object inherit the
 * methods from the 'Print' interface which can be used to build an internal
 * string representation of various objects. Instead of using the
 * `operator+=()` or the `concat()` method, use the `print()`, `println()` (or
 * sometimes the `printf()` method) of the `Print` class. After the internal
 * string is built, the NUL-terminated c-string representation can be retrieved
 * using `getCstr()`.
 *
 * This object is expected to be created on the stack instead of the heap
 * to avoid heap fragmentation. The `SIZE` parameter is a compile time constant,
 * to allow the internal string buffer to be created on the stack. The object
 * will be destroyed automatically when the stack is unwound after returning
 * from the function where this is used.
 *
 * An instance of `PrintString` can be reused by calling the `flush()` method
 * which causes the internal buffer to be cleared to an empty string. An
 * instance of this object could be created statically and reused across
 * different calling sites, but this was not the main intended use of this
 * class.
 *
 * Warning: The contents of `getCstr()` are valid only as long as the
 * PrintString object is alive. The pointer should never be passed to another
 * part of the program if the PrintString object is destroyed before the
 * pointer is used.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * @verbatim
 * #include <print_string.h>
 *
 * using namespace print_string;
 *
 * void fillStringA(PrintString& message) {
 *   message.print("hello, ");
 *   message.println("world!");
 * }
 *
 * void fillStringB(PrintString& message) {
 *   message.print("There are ");
 *   message.print(42);
 *   message.println(" apples");
 * }
 *
 * void someFunction() {
 *   PrintString<32> message;
 *   fillStringA(message)
 *   const char* cstr = message.getCstr();
 *   // do stuff with cstr
 *
 *   message.flush();
 *   fillStringB(message);
 *   cstr = message.getCstr();
 *   // do more stuff with cstr
 * }
 * @endverbatim
 *
 * @tparam SIZE size of internal string buffer including the NUL terminator
 *         character, the maximum is 65535, which means the maximum string
 *         length is 65534 characters.

 * value, instead of a compile-time value.

 * If this object is created dynamically at the beginning of a function, the

 * function, the object will be automatically destroyed, and destruuctor will
 * automatically reclaim the character array on the heap. if no other heap
