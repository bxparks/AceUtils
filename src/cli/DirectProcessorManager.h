 *   ...
 * };

 * const uint8_t BUF_SIZE = 64;
 * const uint8_t ARGV_SIZE = 5;
 * const char PROMPT[] = "$ ";
 *
 * DirectProcessorManager<BUF_SIZE, ARGV_SIZE> commandManager(
 *     Serial, COMMANDS, NUM_COMMANDS, Serial, PROMPT);

 * void setup() {
 *   ...
 *   CoroutineScheduler::setup();
 * }
 *
 * void loop() {
 *   CoroutineScheduler::loop();
